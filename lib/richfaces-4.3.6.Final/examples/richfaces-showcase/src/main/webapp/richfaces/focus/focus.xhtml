        Focus component helps you manage focus of input components in the view.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The component can be used either in <b>a form</b> or <b>in a view</b> - there can be only one focus
        per form and, if both, form- and view-based focuses are defined, a form one takes a priority.
        A view-based focus defines behavior for all forms in a view.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Focus <b>reflects results of validation of components in a view</b>. Focus is given to a first input component in a page which is invalid. The order of input components is
        determined on client-side and it reflects <i>tabindex and position in a page</i>. You can prioritize
        focusing of specific component by increasing its tabindex.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Focus can be configured to <b>keep focus on input component</b> which has been focused before form submission.
    </p>

    <p>
        Focus is <b>applied each time it is rendered</b> - either on form submission or after AJAX request. To turn off focusing after AJAX request, you can use <tt>ajaxRendered=false</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In following example, focus is initially given to Name input. If you enter invalid name (less than 3 chars) and submit (hit enter), focus is given again to Name input. This way user is directed to enter valid input.
